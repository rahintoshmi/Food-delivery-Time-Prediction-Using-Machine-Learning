# Food Delivery Time Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts food delivery times using machine learning algorithms to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. By analyzing factors like distance, delivery person's age and ratings, the system provides accurate delivery time estimates. The Random Forest model outperformed other algorithms with 81% accuracy.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Evaluates KNN, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive plots showing relationships between key features
- **Dynamic Prediction**: Accepts user input for real-time delivery time estimation
- **Performance Metrics**: Compares models using MSE, MAE, and R-squared scores
